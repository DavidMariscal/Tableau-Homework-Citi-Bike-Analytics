Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics


Task
Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you may merge multiple datasets from different periods.
The following are some questions you may wish to tackle. Do not limit yourself to these questions; they are suggestions for a starting point. Be creative!


How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

</p>

By what percentage has total ridership grown?

How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

BASED ON DATA, THESE 10 TOP STATIONS ARE VERY POPULAR FOR STARTING A JOURNEY, DUE TO THEY ARE LOCATED NEARBY TO NYC SUBWAY STATIONS OR NEARBY SCHOOLS AS WELL AS TOURIST SIGHTSEEINGS.

</p>

Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

MY HYPOTHESIS, BASED ON DATA, IS THAT THESE 10 TOP STATIONS ARE VERY POPULAR FOR ENDING A JOURNEY, DUE TO THEY ARE LOCATED NEARBY TO NYC SUBWAY STATIONS OR NEARBY RAILS STATIONS AS WELL AS TOURIST SIGHTSEEINGS LIKE PARKS.

</p>

Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

MY HYPOTHESIS, BASED ON DATA, IS THAT THESE 10 BOTTOM STATIONS ARE NOT POPULAR FOR STARTING A JOURNEY, DUE TO THEY ARE LOCATED FAR AWAY TO NYC SUBWAY STATIONS OR RAILS STATIONS AS WELL AS TOURIST SIGHTSEEINGS LIKE PARKS.OR BECAUSE THEY NEARBY TO DANGEROUS BOROUGHS OR NEIGHBORHOODS.

Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

Next, as a chronic over-achiever:

Use your visualizations (does not have to be all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomena.
The dashboards should be accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring.



Your final submission should include:

A link to your Tableau Public workbook that includes:
